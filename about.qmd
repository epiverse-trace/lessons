## Who are these lessons for?

We thought about Lucia, Patricia, and Anya as learner personas in designing the contents of this training:

- [Lucia](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/personas/lucia-outbreaks.html), a Field Epidemiologist in a National Health Agency that uses R for data cleaning, plotting and automated reports.

- [Patricia](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/personas/patricia-discoverer.html), A PhD student learning to use R and analyse Outbreak data for her research project.

- [Anya](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/personas/anya-academica.html), a Professor who needs ready-to-use teaching material for her research and to pass on to students.

## What design process we follow for these lessons?

- Follow techtogether [design process](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process)
    - Identify the learner persona
        - Their needs are took into account during the whole creation process 
    - Identify the desired data analysis results
        - Define the learning objectives
    - Determine the building blocs
        - Draft a concept map
        - Write the summative assessment
        - Write the formative assessments
    - Plan learning experiences and instructor
        - Create visuals to explain related concepts
            - vision gathers the most information in the short term memory
        - Use callout blocks for complementary info
            - Refer to existing external or internal materials
                - reconlearn
                - appliedepi
                - graphnet
                - rstudio
                - stackoverflow
                - epiverse-trace github issues

The advantage of this approach is to capture the decision about why a material is the way it is.

## What design principles we follow for these lessons?

- Easy to consume in a self-paced manner, 
- Be self-explanatory, 
- Show common mistakes and common misconceptions, and 
- Write practice exercises with diagnostic power for those common misconceptions.
- Show common policy questions connecting data inputs, analysis tasks, and data outputs.
- Show the Epiverse-TRACE pipeline approach
- Order the content to [promote motivation](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:motivation-authentic) 
    - first the less complex (less time to master) and most useful once mastered
- Facilitate the [material maintainability](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:process-maintainability)
    - it should be cheaper to update than to replace it, depending on four factors:
        - good documentation of the course design
        - easy for collaborators to collaborate technically (GitHub or GoogleDocs)
        - will of people to collaborate (train people to have the tools to collab)
        - usefulness for sharing it! (look at rstudio primers and carpentries)
- Follow datasciencebox [five design principles](https://datasciencebox.org/01-design-principles.html)
    - start with the cake
    - cherish day one
    - skip baby steps
    - hide the veggies
    - leverage the ecosystem
- Follow [carpentries design principles](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/08/lesson-template-design/#design-principles-for-the-next-iteration-of-the-carpentries-lesson-template)        

## What is not included in this material?

Topics that are out of the scope of these lessons include:

- How to use Git and GitHub to contribute in Open science projects.

- How to build R packages for data analysis tasks.

## Materials you will need

We will use R. For this you will need to use these instructions:

- Install R <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

## How to contribute?

Improvements and additions very welcome, and can be made through the GitHub repository.
