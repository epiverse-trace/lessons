    "text": "What design principles we follow for these lessons?\nThis section aims to capture the decisions about why a material is the way it is.\n\nA Tutorial documentation format\n\nEasy to consume in a self-paced manner,\nBe self-explanatory,\nShow common mistakes and misconceptions, and\nWrite assessment exercises with diagnostic power for those common misconceptions.\n\nAdd links to related Explanation documentation.\nShow the outbreak analytics pipeline approach connecting common policy questions with analysis tasks, data inputs and outputs.\nOrder the content to promote motivation: first the content that requires the less time to master and most useful once mastered. Aligned with the datasciencebox design principles.\nFacilitate the material maintainability. It should be cheaper to update than to replace it.\nUse the lesson folder structure from The Carpentries workbench, designed accordingly to their design principles.\nFacilitate a multimodal experience:\n\nCreate visuals to explain related concepts. Vision gathers the most information in the short term memory\nCreate slides or other teacher document (e.g. visual qmd files) to facilitate it’s reuse by other instructors for in-person workshops or online trainings.\nCreate interactive videos to create a sense of presence.\nAdd an interactive chatbox for effective one-to-one timely feedback.\nUse callout blocks for complementary info and refer to existing materials from the epidemiology and data science training community: reconlearn, appliedepi, graphnet, rstudio, stackoverflow, github issues and discussions."
